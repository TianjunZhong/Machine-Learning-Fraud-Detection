# Machine-Learning-Fraud-Detection
In this study, we delve into the application of machine learning algorithms for detecting credit card fraud, an area of increasing importance in the field of data security. The project evaluates and compares the effectiveness of four prominent algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Building on existing research, which predominantly focuses on individual algorithm performance, our comparative analysis aims to identify which algorithm most effectively identifies fraud- ulent transactions. We utilize metrics such as the F1 score and the precision-recall curve to assess the algorithms’ performance in handling imbalanced datasets, a common challenge in fraud detection. The study’s findings are intended to contribute to the broader understanding of applying machine learning in financial security, offering insights into optimizing fraud detection systems and enhancing the security of electronic transactions.
